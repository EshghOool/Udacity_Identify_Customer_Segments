# Udacity_Identify_Customer_Segments

### Objective:
In this project,I apply an unsupervised learning technique to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base 
for a mail-order sales company in Germany. 
These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.
